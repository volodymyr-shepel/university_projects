This is a log entry in the Common Log Format (CLF) for an HTTP request made to a server.
[26/Feb/2023:01:55:52 +0100]
Here is a breakdown of the different components of the log entry:

IP address: 45.83.64.107
Date and time: 26/Feb/2023:00:20:26 +0100
HTTP request method, URL and protocol version: "GET / HTTP/1.1"
HTTP status code: 301
Size of the response in bytes: 231
Referrer: "-"
User agent: "Mozilla/5.0 (Windows NT 10.0; Win64; x64; rv:65.0) Gecko/20100101 Firefox/65.0"
The log entry indicates that a client with the IP address 45.83.64.107 made a GET request for the root ("/") of a web server using the
HTTP/1.1 protocol. The server responded with a 301 (Moved Permanently) status code, indicating that the requested resource has been 
moved to a different location. The size of the response was 231 bytes. The referrer field is empty ("-"), indicating that the client did 
not provide a referrer header in the request. The user agent field indicates that the client was using Firefox version 65.0 on Windows 10
(Win64 architecture).

In the log entry, the first hyphen "-" after the IP address and client identity fields represents the remote user's name. The remote user's
name field is not used very often, and in most cases, it is not relevant or not available. Therefore, it is represented by a hyphen "-" in
the log entry.

The second hyphen "-" in the log entry represents the user identity field, which is also optional and not used very often. In many cases,
the user identity field is not relevant or not available, and thus the hyphen "-" is used as a placeholder in the log entry.

What is meant by referrer header?
In an HTTP request, the referrer header (also known as the "referer header") provides information about the URL of the web page that the 
client was on when it clicked a link or submitted a form to make the current request. The referrer header is sent by the client to the 
server, and it is part of the HTTP request header.

For example, if a user is on a web page "A" and clicks on a link to go to another web page "B", the referrer header in the request for
 web page "B" would contain the URL of the previous web page "A". This information can be useful for the server to track the user's 
navigation path on the website and to analyze traffic sources.

It is important to note that the referrer header is optional, and some clients (such as privacy-focused browsers or security software) 
may not send the referrer header to protect the user's privacy or to prevent information leakage. Additionally, some websites may choose
to block or modify the referrer header for security or privacy reasons.
